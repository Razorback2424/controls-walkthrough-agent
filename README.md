# controls-walkthrough-agent

This repository contains a simple Python script for an audit practice simulator. It demonstrates how to connect to OpenAI's API and run a conversational walkthrough based on uploaded client process documents and professional standards.

To use the simulator:
1. Install the `openai` package: `pip install openai`.
2. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Upload your documents to OpenAI and update the file IDs in `controls_walkthrough_agent.py`.
4. Run the script with `python controls_walkthrough_agent.py`.
